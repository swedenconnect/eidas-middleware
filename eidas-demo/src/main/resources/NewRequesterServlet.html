<p>The following links include the SPType value in the SAML request. As the SPType must not present both in
    the request
    and metadata, disable the SPType value in the metadata of the demo by setting "demo.metadata.sptype=none"
    in the
    application.properties of the demo application. Do not forget to update the metadata file in the
    middleware's
    configuration and to restart the middleware in case you have changed the SPType configuration for the
    demo.</p>
